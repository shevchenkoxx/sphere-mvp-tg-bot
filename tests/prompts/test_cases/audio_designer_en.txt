Hi everyone! I'm Jessica, a product designer based in Berlin. I've been doing UX and UI design for about 8 years now, mostly in fintech and healthcare startups.

Currently I'm freelancing and building my own design agency. I specialize in design systems, user research, and helping early-stage startups build their first products.

I'm super passionate about accessibility and inclusive design. I believe good design should work for everyone, not just the majority.

At this event, I'm looking to meet founders who need design help, and other designers who might want to collaborate or join the agency. Also interested in connecting with investors who understand the value of design.

I can help with everything from user research to high-fidelity prototypes, design systems, and even hiring designers. Check out my portfolio at jessicadesigns.co
