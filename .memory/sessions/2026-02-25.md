# 2026-02-25 — Design & Planning Session

## Context
Branch: `community-v1` (new, from `global-mode-v1`) | Bot: @Matchd_bot | Deploy: not yet

## Changes
- [docs] Design doc — full community mode architecture — `docs/plans/2026-02-25-community-v1-design.md`
- [docs] Implementation plan — 26 tasks, 3 phases — `docs/plans/2026-02-25-community-v1-implementation.md`
- [docs] Git memory format upgraded — commits as primary memory — `.memory/FORMAT.md`
- [chore] Branch `community-v1` created from `global-mode-v1`
- [chore] Worktree `worktrees/sphere-community/` created
- [chore] Worktree `worktrees/sphere-global/` created
- [chore] Old `v1.1` worktree removed
- [chore] `sphere-bot/` switched to `main` (archive)
- [chore] GitHub repo description updated (legacy note)
- [data] CORAD event created in Supabase + QR sent via Telegram
- [feat] `/quickevent` command + QR generation (on global-mode-v1, inherited)
- [fix] Event join ordering bug fixed (on global-mode-v1, inherited)

## Commits
- `84a83ec` — /quickevent, QR gen, enable events, fix join ordering (global-mode-v1)
- `6c19105` — Community-v1 design document (global-mode-v1, inherited by community-v1)
- `eee1560` — Community-v1 implementation plan (community-v1)

## Decisions Made
- Same DB for all modes (no separate DB for community)
- Branch from global-mode-v1 (not main) for community-v1
- One bot, multiple modes (community + event + global)
- Events as separate future branch (events-v2)
- Games drive DM traffic via deep links (bot can't initiate DMs)
- Monetization: free community matching, $3/cross-community, $10/mo Pro
- Git commits as primary long-term memory

## Next
- Start Phase 1, Task 1: DB migration
- Open Claude session in `worktrees/sphere-community/` for execution
